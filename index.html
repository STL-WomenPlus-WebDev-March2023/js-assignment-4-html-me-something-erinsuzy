      <h2>Grocery bagger</h2>
      <p>I started my formal employment history as a "Customer Service Clerk" at Schnucks. I bagged groceries, returned stock, collected carts from the parking lot, and helped people load their groceries in their cars. I met my first boyfriend at this job and still use the skills I learned to bag my own groceries. </p>
      <h2> Dental receptionist/assistant</h2>
      <p>My dentist's wife ran his office. She asked me to come and work for them after school when I was a junior in high school. I left Schnucks for this "cushy" desk job. I learned how to submit insurance claims, update charts, file, answer the phone professionally, and collect payments. The dentist I worked for was left-handed and thus had a problem keeping assistants. I started training to be his assistant the next year. I enjoyed working with the patients. I learned a lot of DOS computer skills, phone etiquette, and how to be friendly to everyone. </p>
      <h2>Cashier</h2>
      <p>When I went to college, my parents didn't want me to work my first year. When I came home for the summer, I wanted a job that was very low stress. I got a job at Home Quarters, which was a store like Home Depot or Lowe's. I enjoyed working in the big box store setting. I was quickly promoted to pricing items and answering the phones. When I moved back to college, I worked at the local grocery store as a cashier. I moved back home again to finish school the next year and went to work for Schnucks as a cashier. These jobs helped me learn how merchandising works. They were low stress and I met a lot of friends at work.</p>
      <h2>Paraprofessional</h2>
      <p>My mom worked for the local school district and wanted me to get a job there as well. So I applied to become a paraprofessional, which is basically a teacher's aide. I worked at the Early Childhood Special Education building with integrated groups of children. Some of the children had special needs and qualified to go to the school for free, but other children in the school district could also attend at a price. I rode the bus every day and made sure the children were safely buckled in and kept them occupied on the way to and from school. I loved working with the children and ended up changing my major to Early Childhood Education because I found it so fulfilling to work with the children. I also worked as a substitute teacher and enjoyed working with children of all ages and all abilities. I have worked in a in-patient hospital for children with disabilities becasue it was in the school district. This job taught me how to connect with children and that I loved teaching.</p>
      <h2>Delivery driver</he>
      <p>I moved back home my senior year in college. I quit my job at Schnucks and needed another job over the summer to make extra money. I loved driving and had my own car, so I went to work for Domino's Pizza. This was before cell phones and Google Maps. They had a map of our service area on the wall in the back, I would have to memorize directions to the houses. I also delivered food for a Chinese restaurant after I quit Domino's. The next year, I would get a job at Imo's. I was good at delivering food. I have a great sense of direction and was not afraid of going anywhere. I worked for Imo's in South City and it could be a dangerous job. I learned how to navigate unknown streets easily and how to drive nearly any car. I went through a lot of cars in those days. I am never afraid to drive because I know that I can always turn around and I can nearly always find a place again if I've driven to it once.</p>
      <h2>Teacher</h2>
      <p>I graduated college with a Bachelor's of Science in Early Childhood Education. I got a job immediately in the Shaw neighborhood for St. Louis Public Schools teaching first grade. I was going to save the world! I hated it right away. I was not good at classroom management. I was short-tempered and would end up yelling nearly every day. I left that job in March (started at Imos'). The next year, I got a job in Troy, MO. I moved back home and drove to Troy every day to teach kindergarten. I still had classroom management problems. I understood that teaching wasn't for me. I made it through that year, but didn't renew my contract. This was the worst job I ever had. I am not good at managing 30 young children. I may have been a good teacher in a preschool setting, but I think I was happier as a paraprofessional. In trying to control my classroom, I learned about how to focus on the good behavior and reward that behavior heavily.</p>
      <h2>TSA Oofficer</h2>
      <p>When I was teaching kindergarten, 9/11 happened. The next year, I was delivering pizzas when they announced hiring for TSA in St. Louis. My sister knew someone who was hired as a supervisor. I signed up and went through the testing and hiring process. I was hired as a Lead Officer. I had a team of people under me. It was a hard job at first, we worked 10 hour days, 7 days a week for a few months. I enjoyed the income from the job, but it didn't pay enough to deal with angry people. I worked there for 7 years. I moved around a lot because I would get bored of working in one spot. I changed job locations and shifts a lot. I left the job when I thought I could make my side business work. I was tired of being hated at work. This job taught me a lot about working with people. I realized I am not a people person and I don't want to deal with the public every day. I know how thankless the job is and I try to be the perfect passenger when I go through security now.</p>
      <h2>Pet sitter/dog walker</h2>
      <p>While working at TSA, I started pet sitting. I knew a woman at work who was also a pet sitter and groomer on the side. She encouraged me and my partner at the time to start pet sitting. I got business cards and created a business name. I did this in addition to working at TSA. When my ex started working at Petco, they were in contact with a lot of people who needed help caring for their animals. I started walking dogs for some of the customers. I added that as a service for our business, took out an ad in Ladue News, and created my first website. I remember looking at the code when I was creating the site and playing with it to get it to look good. After my breakup with my partner and we split the clients from the business, I took over most of the daily dog walking clients and some of the pet sitting clients. I still walk dogs daily and pet sit on occasion. This taught me how NOT to run a business. I learned the importance of being bonded and insured in order to cover any issues that may arise. Staying in strangers' houses can be daunting sometimes, I have learned how to clean up after myself. Also, a lot of people have special needs animals. I have had to create daily schedules for medicines to make sure that I am keeping the animals healthy.</p>
      <h2>Seasonal jobs</h2>
      <p>After I quit TSA, but before I got most of my dog walking clients, I had a year where I had to work seasonal jobs to make rent and car payments. I got a job at Six Flags about 5 months after quitting TSA. I was humbled to be working at an entry level position at 33 years old (which I thought was really old at the time). I worked at a retail cart at the front of the park. I enjoyed the job, but it was minimum wage and seasonal. I got a job at Macy's, working in the call center. That was also a seasonal job through Christmas. When I started at Macy's, I thought I quit Six Flags (I left a voicemail), but I received a letter in the mail saying I was fired. I was embarrassed to be fired from Six Flags, but only because that was the only job that fired me. At Macy's, I was able to use my professional phone voice and excellent customer service skills I learned in my previous jobs. I also loved that we were able to research in the mainframe computer to find items that may not appear on the website. I loved looking through the mainframe to find obscure items in stores. I learned how to talk to provide customer service to upscale customers because Bloomingdale's is owned by Macy's. I had to take calls for both websites. I had a different Bloomindale's voice, lower and more posh. This has taught me how to talk to my clients who have money. I nearly took a full-time position at this job, I excelled at it. But the business was growing and I decided to leave at the end of the season.</p>
      <h2>Dog trainer</h2>
      <p>My former partner and I trained dogs. They went through training classes at Petco to learn how to train dogs. I never felt comfortable giving training advice, even though I knew a lot of what to do. After we split the business and ended the relationship, I stuck with dog walking and pet sitting for a few years. In 2017, I decided to go to school to become certified as a dog trainer. I researched schools and landed on Karen Pryor Academy. This is one of the top schools for educating positive reinforcement dog trainers. I borrowed money from my clients for the course and went through the intensive 6-month class. I graduated with high marks and started training dogs. I mostly focus on in-home, private dog training. I have had one puppy class during the pandemic that wasn't very successful. I never could find a place to hold classes, so I go to people's houses to train. I love working with dogs. It uses a lot of the child psychology I learned when I went to college to be a teacher. I really enjoy working with dogs, it's so satisfying to see the behavioral changes in them. I work with "reactive" dogs. Dogs who bite, growl, or are afraid of everything. I am good at it, but I am getting burnt out because I have to work 6-7 days a week because of people's schedules. I have learned a lot about dogs and dog behavior from working closely with dogs and their owners. I have also learned a lot about human behavior when it comes to dogs. Many people still subscribe to old notions of being the alpha and they yell or hit their dogs when the dog is showing normal dog behavior. Often people want the dog's behavior to change, but don't want to change their own behavior. If nothing changes, nothing changes.</p>
